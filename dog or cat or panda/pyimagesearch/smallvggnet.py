# VGGNet-like models share two common characteristics:

# 1. Only 3Ã—3 convolutions are used
# 2. onvolution layers are stacked on top of each other deeper in the network
# architecture prior to applying a destructive pooling operation

		# increase accuracy, and allow our network to generalize better
		# for unfamiliar images. As denoted by the parameter, 25% of the
		# node connections are randomly disconnected (dropped out)
		# between layers during each training iteration.
